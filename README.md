# express-userlogin-ex
* I'm trying out the express framework and the express-session npm package in this repo.

There's only one person that can login, admin with a password of admin. 

That login data is stored in the server.js file.

This isn't something you would use in production, but it demonstrates how to use the express-session package for a beginner.
